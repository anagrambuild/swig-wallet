//! Error types for the Swig wallet program.
//!
//! This module defines all possible error conditions that can occur during
//! program execution. The errors are categorized into several groups:
//! - Account validation errors
//! - Authority-related errors
//! - Instruction processing errors
//! - Sub-account management errors
//! - Permission and security errors
